# kittens-everywhere

This project is one that I'm building as a web extension example on a course.

When activated, it will replace the pictures on a website with cute pics of kittens.

## Current status

On the first 30 minute session, we got to the result where clicking the button will activate a green border around the website.

Next time we'll add the actual kittens.
